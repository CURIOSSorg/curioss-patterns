# Individual consultations / Office Hours

# Pattern Summary

Offer consultations to students, researchers and faculty about their open source projects.

# Problem / Challenge

There is inconsistent knowledge across a university of:

* How to create and use open source software (OSS) effectively.
* How to follow open source best practices / standards.
* Additional resources and services available to open source projects.
* Licensing frameworks and alternatives.

Students, researchers and faculty need guidance to identify the appropriate solutions for their specific challenges.

# Pattern Category

Below is a list of common categories of academic OSPO activities \- please choose which apply:

* Building University OSS Community
* Sharing OSS Best Practices
* Working with Tech Transfer / External Partners
* Supporting OSS development
* Funding & Financial Support

# Context

A university with diverse departments of varying levels of OSS expertise and needs.

There is inconsistent awareness about the role of OSS standards in improving scientific quality and generating results that are reproducible and trustworthy.

There is inconsistent awareness of OSS license management and compliance with institutional and IP policies.

An OSPO with the resources/capacity to offer one-to-one consultations and any required follow-up work.

# Forces

Students and researchers do not know how or where to access the information they need. 

OSPO staff have the capacity/availability to meet for consultations.

The OSPO or project lead has a working knowledge of and relationships with TTO, contract, and other staff/faculty who are positioned to support students.

# Solution

Offer individual consultations or ‘office hours’ as a service to answer questions and/or provide support to open source projects.

This can be offered through a number of different channels:

* Providing a contact email address on the OSPO website.
* Booking a slot using a scheduling tool on the OSPO’s website.
* Integrating and advertising OSPO consultations as part of a Department’s wider consultation services.
* Providing individual consultations whenever requested.

# Resulting Context

Research teams and projects benefit from personalized guidance along with referrals to complementary university support services.

## Additional Learning from Carnegie Mellon University OSPO
We use this [consultation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ybyObRt8XOlrjK-CgCXBPImryWV-b4M9_OIfyAbUwo8/edit#slide=id.g2c709938643_0_8) to guide the conversation with projects and to assess their needs.

## Additional Learning from University of California Santa Cruz OSPO
We meet with projects to offer advice and support as needed. This is often a one-time call but sometimes grows into grant proposals or longer collaborations.

## Additional Learning from University of Vermont VERSO OSPO
Most of our consultations come from internal referrals or the Tech Transfer Office.
