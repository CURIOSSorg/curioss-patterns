# Host an Open Source Conference

# Pattern Summary

Host a conference or high profile event on the theme of open source to increase the visibility of the academic OSPO and to demonstrate its value.

# Problem / Challenge

A lack of awareness and visibility of an academic OSPO may create a number of challenges for the OSPO including: 

* Students, faculty and staff may not know that the OSPO exists or understand its relevance to their work.
* Open source efforts continue to take place in siloes across departments, research groups and student organizations.
* The impact of academic contributions from the OSPO’s institution are not recognized.
* The OSPO experiences difficulties in connecting with internal and/or external partners.

# Pattern Category

Below is a list of common categories of academic OSPO activities \- please choose which apply:

- Building University OSS Community
- Demonstrating value as an OSPO
- Funding & Financial Support
- Sharing OSS Best Practices
- OSS Advocacy and Policy 
- OSS Education & Skills  
- Working with Tech Transfer / External Partners  

# Context

A university with diverse departments of varying levels of OSS expertise and needs.

An OSPO has been established.

# Forces

Students, researchers and faculty do not know how or where to access information and support from the OSPO that they need.

An OSPO with the capacity to organize / co-organize events.

Resources are available to finance or part-fund the event.

# Solution

Host a conference or large scale event to boost visibility of the OSPO and to foster networks with strategic partners. 

The following tasks cover the broad areas of work that will need to be undertaken:

## Assemble a planning team and program committee
* Include representatives from faculty, students, administration, and the OSPO.
* Designate leads for logistics, communications, programming, registration and sponsorships.

## Define the purpose of the conference and the target audience
* Clarify the event’s goal: awareness, collaboration, training, research alignment, etc.
* Identify primary audiences: students, faculty, external partners, open source maintainers, members of the wider open source ecosystem.

## Choose the Format and Scope
* Decide on a format: single-day symposium, multi-day conference, hackathon, unconference, etc.
* Determine whether the event will be in-person, hybrid, or virtual.

## Secure Institutional Support
* Get buy-in from university departments, IT, facilities, and legal if necessary.
* Consider co-branding with departments, research groups, or external sponsors.

## Set a Budget and Seek Funding
* Estimate costs (venue, catering, A/V, travel costs).
* Apply for internal university funds, external sponsorships, or community grants (e.g., OSI, GitHub, Google Open Source).

## Create a program that reflects OSPO goals
* Use mailing lists, posters, social media, department announcements, and partner networks to advertise the Call for Papers.
* Invite keynote speakers and other key strategic partners who can discuss open source in research, education, and industry.
* Include hands-on sessions (workshops, sprints) to promote learning and engagement.
* Spotlight student and faculty open source projects.

## Publicize the event
* Use mailing lists, posters, social media, department announcements, and partner networks to advertise the event itself.
* Highlight opportunities to present, mentor, or sponsor.

## Ensure Inclusivity and Accessibility
* Provide hybrid/remote options, captioning, and accessibility accommodations.
* Follow a code of conduct and make it visible.

## Document and Archive the Event
* Record sessions, collect slides, and publish post-event write-ups.
* Archive on OSPO web pages or repositories for future reference.

## Follow Up and Sustain Engagement
* Gather feedback
* Send thanks to participants and sponsors.
* Share outcomes publicly (blogs, newsletters, reports).
* Build on the momentum for future events, projects, or community activities.


# Resulting Context

There are a wide range of potential benefits to hosting a conference or event for an academic OSPO:

**Community Building:** Brings together students, faculty, and external collaborators to explore open source on campus.

**Education and Skills:**  Events present an opportunity to offer introductory workshops, hackathons, and mentoring opportunities that build technical and community skills among students and researchers.

**Institutional Recognition:** OSPO events can position the university as a leader in open source innovation and potentially influencing rankings, funding opportunities, and partnerships.

**Knowledge Sharing:** OSPO conferences facilitate the exchange of ideas, best practices, and research between diverse disciplines and institutions.

**Recruitment and Retention:** OSPO events can create appealing learning and networking opportunities that attract new students and keep them engaged throughout their academic career.

**Funding and Sponsorship Opportunities:** A well-attended event can attract sponsorships from industry, nonprofits, and government agencies interested in supporting open source.

**Documentation and Legacy:** Conferences often result in proceedings, videos, and other artifacts that can serve as resources and inspiration long after the event ends.

# Additional Learning

## Additional Learning from the Georgia Tech Open Source Program Office

We also provide information about funding opportunities such as the Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) at our conferences. This is a great way to connect projects to funding programs that they may not be aware of.

## Additional Learning from the GW Open Source Program Office

We used Drupal to host our conference pages and to manage our registration and CFP forms.  

We used [VolunteerSignup](https://volunteersignup.org/) which is free for non-commercial use (but may not be open source).
