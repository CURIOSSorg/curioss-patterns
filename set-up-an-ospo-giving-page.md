# Set up an OSPO Giving Page

# Pattern Summary
Channel direct funding to an academic OSPO by setting up a donations or giving page that aligns with the institution’s financial systems.

# Problem / Challenge
Academic OSPOs are emerging entities within academia that typically depend on short-term grant funding rather than stable institutional budgets. Unlike traditional university fundraising that often relies on alumni networks and established development offices, OSPOs need to attract support from technology companies, open source foundations, individual developers and other non-traditional academic supporters who may have varying levels of familiarity with university partnership processes.

There are a number of bureaucratic challenges for academic OSPOs seeking to establish accessible donation pathways for potential donors and sponsors: 
* **Complex financial systems** that discourage spontaneous or smaller contributions from a diverse range of potential funders or sponsors (individuals, startups, enterprises, foundations).
* **A lack of information about how to direct donations to OSPOs** and/or other specialized units on the institution’s website.
* **A need for transparent financial processes** that meet the institution’s financial compliance obligations.
* **Potential difficulties in accepting unrestricted funds** that can be deployed flexibly across OSPO priorities and opportunities.

# Pattern Category
- Funding & Financial Support
   
# Context
A research university creating large volumes of research outputs across every discipline.

An OSPO has been established.

A stable budget line for the OSPO and/or open source initiatives may not be established within the institution.

# Forces
Potential donors and sponsors may not know how to donate directly to the OSPO.

OSPO staff members have the capacity/availability to collaborate with finance colleagues on a solution.

Procurement and payment guidelines allow for once-off or flexible donations directly to the OSPO.

# Solution
Set up an OSPO donations/giving page that complies with the university’s funding requirements.

## Create Clear Financial Infrastructure
Contact and/or meet finance colleagues to understand the institution’s processes and requirements for donations. Typical points to consider include: 

* How donations are tracked.
* Setting up accounts or references for donations to the OSPO.
* Payment methods for donors (e.g. cash, checks, EFT).
* Protocols for invoicing and receipts.
* Protocols for sharing information on the website.

## Develop a communications strategy and supporting materials
* Develop a strategy for promoting direct donations through the giving page and acknowledging donors on the OSPO’s website, materials and communication platforms.
* Consider developing a prospectus outlining different donor or sponsorship ‘packages’ , options for once-off smaller contributions and information about how donations will be used.

## Set up an OSPO Giving Page
* Create a dedicated page on the OSPO’s website.
* Ensure the page clearly identifies its purpose.
* Provide clear instructions for each payment method.
* Include contact information for an OSPO staff member who can act as the liaison for donors.
* Add any relevant supporting materials e.g. a donation/sponsorship prospectus, information about donation usage and impact.

# Resulting Context
A dedicated giving page produces positive outcomes for the OSPO, donors and the wider academic institution.

## Benefits for the OSPO
* Greater opportunities for attracting diversified and sustainable funding streams over time.
* Increased access to donations from sponsors of all sizes and organizational types.
* A channel for securing dedicated resources for high profile activities or events. 

## Benefits for Donors
* Flexible contribution levels from individual donations to major sponsorships.
* More convenient payment options that fit with organizational processes.
* A clear understanding of how OSPO contributions will be used.

## Benefits for the Academic Institution
* Compliance with university financial policies. 
* New revenue streams that support institutional open source initiatives.
* Potential for enhanced industry/donor relationships as a result of OSPO funding.

Our [OSPO giving page](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/bankinfo/) links to our [UCSC donation page](https://give.ucsc.edu/campaigns/38026/donations/new?designation=opensourcesoftwareresearchcross&). It’s very simple at our end and we have used it for industry sponsorship of events.
