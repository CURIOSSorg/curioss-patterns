# OSPO as *Lead* Principal Investigator

# Pattern Summary
Leverage OSPO staffâ€™s open source expertise skills to address relevant issues as lead Principal Investigators (PIs) on funding proposals.

# Problem / Challenge
There has been a growth in recognition of the value of open source software amongst funders. Increasingly, funders require software to be released as open source and to make research outputs publicly available.

However, research proposals do not tend to focus on the development of foundational or sustainable infrastructure that serves a wide range of scientific communities.

# Pattern Category
- Advocacy, Governance & Policy
- Demonstrating value as an Academic OSPO
- Funding & Financial Support
- Open Source Development
- Open Source Sustainability
- Promoting Best Practices
   
# Context
A university or research institution that submits grant proposals to federal, state or private funding sources.

OSPOs have established credibility through successful support of multiple grant proposals.

An OSPO with the resources/capacity for staff to take on PI leadership responsibilities.

# Forces
Growing funder emphasis on open science practices and reproducibility.

The OSPO and/or specific OSPO staff have a track record of successful open source project management.

# Solution
Apply for funding as the lead PI for projects that are crucial to supporting the sustainability and/or reproducibility of research infrastructure and outputs.

# Resulting Context
The OSPO has an opportunity to deliver demonstration projects that showcase the impact of open source best practices.

The OSPO independently secures funding streams that may support its sustainability as an organization.

The institution develops a stronger reputation for open science leadership.

PI responsibilities will need to be balanced against other OSPO responsibilities. OSPOs may risk overcommitment if PI opportunities rapidly multiply.
