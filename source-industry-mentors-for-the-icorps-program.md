# Source Industry Mentors for the I-Corps program

# Pattern Summary
Use internal university connections to source industry mentors who can commit to the 40 hour mentoring program requirement needed for the NSF I-Corps training program.

# Problem / Challenge
[NSF I-Corps program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps) funding requires applicants to set up their own [I-Corps Teams](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps/about-teams) consisting of a technical lead, entrepreneurial lead and an industry mentor. 

Faculty may face significant challenges in sourcing industry mentors with the availability and/or expertise who can provide 40 hours of guidance throughout the seven week intensive entrepreneurial training program. 

# Pattern Category

Below is a list of common categories of academic OSPO activities \- please choose which apply:

- Demonstrating value as an OSPO
- Education & Skills
- Funding & Financial Support
- Open Source Sustainability
- Promoting Best Practices
- Supporting OSS development
- Working with Tech Transfer / External Partners

# Context
A university or research institution based in the United States. 

Researcher(s) from the university are eligible to apply for the I-Corps program but are having difficulties in finding an appropriate industry mentor.

# Forces
An OSPO with the capacity to source mentors on behalf of I-Corps applicants or with the capacity to participate in the program.

# Solution
Engage with the institution's existing innovation and industry infrastructure to source mentors through warm introductions or established relationships through the following channels:

+ **Technology Transfer Office (TTO):** Leverage relationships with industry partners, licensing contacts, and entrepreneurs who have previously commercialized university technologies.
+ **Innovation and Entrepreneurship Centers:** Colleagues based in these centers may be accepted as industry mentors. Staff will also have contacts and relationships with industry mentors from relevant fields.
+ **Industry Relations/Corporate Partnerships:** Advisory boards, research sponsors, and strategic partnership contacts may also yield mentors.
+ **Alumni Networks:** Entrepreneurial alumni, particularly those in startup ecosystems or corporate innovation roles may have a particular interest in participating as industry mentors.
+ **Existing Entrepreneurship Programs:** Advisory board members, guest lecturers and faculty based in the institution’s business schools, incubators, accelerators, and other entrepreneurship initiatives may provide a useful source of mentors.
+ **Faculty Industry Connections:** Explore faculty consulting relationships, sabbatical contacts, and collaborative research partners.

## Other actions to consider
+ Establish a mentor ‘database’ with expertise areas, availability windows a log of when they were approached to participate.
+ Develop a brief information guide explaining the I-Corps program, requirements and time commitments. 
+ Create a standardized industry mentor profile template with the information required for the I-Corps executive summary and proposal.
+ Devise a process for recognizing and rewarding industry mentors who participate.

# Resulting Context
Leveraging established networks (over cold outreach) to source mentors is likely to reduce recruitment time. 

Systematic relationship development should support the creation of a sustainable mentor pipeline.

Offering support with grant proposals develops and strengthens relationships with colleagues, faculty, researchers and students.

## Additional learning from Carnegie Mellon University OSPO
As a staff member of the OSPO, I was able to make the case for applying as the industry mentor. I didn’t need ‘a ton’ of industry experience to fully participate and I was able to support each group to make the connections needed for their required short interviews.

I would say that it was definitely valuable to go through as an industry mentor and find out what the training entails.

## Additional learning from OpenSource@Stanford
We relied on personal networks and connections made through our [Maintainers & Contributors Roundtable program](https://opensource.stanford.edu/programs/maintainers-contributors-roundtable). 

We found that retired industry experts had more time and availability to commit to the program.

## Additional Learning from University of California Santa Cruz
We are working with our Innovation and Entrepreneurship Hub staff. They can be part of the team and act as the industry mentor. Our folks have previous I-Corps experience so it is really valuable to have them on the team
