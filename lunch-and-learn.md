# OSPO Problem / Challenge

OSPO is tasked with developing a response to a new federal or funding requirement across the institution (e.g. updates to requirements in relation to public funding, public access, open access, open science etc.).

# Context

* A university with a large and diverse research and instructional cohort.
* New Government Directives or funding programs issue requirements that impact many (or all) Departments within a university.   
* The response required may vary according to the discipline.
* There is a lack of coordination across the university, with individual faculty finding solutions on their own. 

# Forces

* Requirements are driven by Government Directives and/or new funding requirements.
* There is a concern that faculty may not be fully compliant with the new requirements.
* It is unclear how new compliance requirements relate to good practice standards in relation to open source software, open source projects and open science.

# Solution

Scope and research the problem. Use the findings to drive faculty engagement at ‘lunch-and-learn’ events.

The solution below outlines basic core activities to consider:

## Research

* Conduct interviews with selected faculty and administrative staff.  
* Review how the new requirement affects a sample of disciplines.  
* Review how other universities are responding to the requirement.

## Lunch-and-Learn event

* Invite faculty and relevant administration to the event.   
* At the event, present findings and share best practice guidelines.  
* Faculty members will also give short presentations on their needs and the solutions they’ve adopted.

# Resulting Context

Faculty have shared learning about potential solutions across a range of disciplines. 

A network of key faculty and staff can be developed further to share learning and problem-solve in the future. 

A report capturing key learning about the requirement, compliance and good practice can be circulated widely across the university.

## Additional learning from Syracuse University OSPO

In our case, the OSPO was tasked with supporting the development of comprehensive data management and public access guidelines (in response to the [Nelson Memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-2023-Memorandum_on_Framework_Delivery.pdf)).

Interviews with faculty and sample review of grants and what other universities are doing illustrated the scope of the problem, potential complications and some potential solutions. 

The faculty luncheon was a success. Attendees found it extremely useful to hear what type of data other faculty were producing, and what they were doing to share it. They also really enjoyed the opportunity to communicate with others across disciplines and with research and library administrators. There was a strong desire to hold more such events in the future. The faculty’s slides were compiled into a single slide deck, which can be accessed from the OSPO website.

Our investigation and the faculty luncheon resulted in a formal report from the Senate Research Committee to the broader University Senate.
